## Introduction:

"Elections, by their nature, deviate from the concept of "Black Swan" events*. According to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the proponent of the Black Swan theory, an event with a probability of 50/50 does not fit within this classification (La Roche, 2016). Consequently, we may contend that if elections inherently avoid categorization as Black Swan events, they could conceivably be predictable - a state perhaps better designated as 'Gray Swan' phenomena.

 ** A "Black Swan" event is a term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book "The Black Swan". A Black Swan event is defined as an event or occurrence that deviates beyond what is normally expected of a situation and is extremely difficult to predict. These events are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight.
