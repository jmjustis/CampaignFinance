## Introduction:

"Elections, by their nature, deviate from the concept of "Black Swan" events*. According to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the proponent of the Black Swan theory, an event with a probability of 50/50 does not fit within this classification (La Roche, 2016). Consequently, we may contend that if elections inherently avoid categorization as Black Swan events, they could conceivably be predictable - a state perhaps better designated as 'Gray Swan' phenomena.

 ** 
 A "Black Swan" event is a term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book "The Black Swan". A Black Swan event is defined as an event or occurrence that deviates beyond what is normally expected of a situation and is extremely difficult to predict. These events are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight.

This proposition implies that in the absence of stationarity and ergodicity, a system may yet be predictable, contingent upon the application of suitable features in machine learning methodologies. Additionally, if significant factors like campaign spending are included within these features, it could empower a data scientist to ascertain the 'optimal' or 'ideal bet size' that a campaign manager should dedicate to an election campaign to ensure victory.
In this study, we explore the influence of campaign finance on election outcomes through the application of machine learning algorithms. Our analysis transcends the boundaries of simple exploratory data analysis. We critically assess which models demonstrate the highest efficacy for these predictive tasks. Ultimately, we employ the predicted probability outcomes from the best-performing algorithms to establish the Kelly criterion, thereby determining the optimal campaign budget allocation.


## Analysis and Models:

### 	About the Data:
The data presented in the data set itself has a lot of dimensionality but does give incredible insight on how political campaigns allocate their money. Down below in Table 1.1, it can be seen the type of data that was provided.
